# Detox DHT
You're on `next` branch right now. It is created for [major DHT reimplementation](https://github.com/Detox/dht/issues/1) instead of previous Mainline DHT-based, which was used on early stages in order to build MVP.

`master` branch is where you can find version of `@detox/dht` that is published on NPM.
